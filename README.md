# 🛡️ Open Source Firewall Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project was created to introduce myself further into **cybersecurity** and **network concepts**, specifically:
- Setting up an **open source firewall** on Ubuntu using `iptables`
- Understanding **tables, chains, and rules**
- Gaining hands-on experience with **port numbers** and their use
- Testing traffic with tools like **curl** and validating with **Wireshark**

The goal was not only to learn theory, but to **practically apply it** — configuring a firewall, running tests, and visually confirming blocked/allowed packets.
