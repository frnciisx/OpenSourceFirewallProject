ðŸ”¥ Firewall Rules (iptables)

This page documents the firewall rules used in the **Open Source Firewall Project**.  
Each rule includes the command, its purpose, and how it was tested (with `curl`, `ping`, or Wireshark).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Default Policies
Before applying custom rules, the default policies were set to **ACCEPT** for a clean baseline.

```bash
# Firewall Rules â€“ Open Source Firewall Project

These rules were tested and verified using curl, ping, and Wireshark.
